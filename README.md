## Overview
This project implements and evaluates shortest path algorithms on weighted graphs using Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford methods.  
The system computes optimal paths, compares algorithm performance, and visualizes graph structures.

## Features
- Weighted graph representation
- Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
- Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm
- Path cost evaluation
- Algorithm comparison
- Graph visualization using Python

## Technologies
- C++
- Python
- Graph Theory
- Data Structures
- Algorithm Analysis

## How it Works
1. Graph data is processed in C++
2. Shortest paths are computed using:
   - Dijkstra algorithm
   - Bellman-Ford algorithm
3. Results are exported
4. Python visualizes graph and paths

## Run

### C++
g++ main.cpp -o graph
./graph

### Python
python visualize.py
